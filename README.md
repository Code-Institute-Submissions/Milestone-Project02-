### Strategy

The Key demographic for this project are couples spanning from newly-weds up to retired couples. They will be going for a very special occasion such as honeymoon or wedding anniversary or for a spectacular holiday.

#### User Stories

I Identified the following relating to the strategy I explained.

I know exactly where I want to go on holiday (Bora Bora)
I want to find out what choices I have and what their is to see and do.
I want a five star experience.
I don't know where I want to go on holiday but I want to know what this destination has to offer.
Where can I go to eat or drink on my stay, what's the address / does it have a website / what's their phone number.
I want to plan on what to do and what to visit before I go.
I want to know the weather for the time of year I am going.

### Scope

Having identified the type of users, I used this in the planning including layout, what features would be needed to help the user and kind of palette to attract the user to explore the website.

#### Functional & Content Requirements

1. The website must (peacock) show off the beauty of the destination with.
2. The website must have an eye-catching front page to grab the user.
3. The website must used a range of components/layout to help show off all that the destination has to offer using gallery, sliders and media such as video.
4. The website should feel light and bright to represent the destination and bring that holiday feel.
5. The website should have a palette that appeals to a wide range of ages mas outlined in the strategy.

### Structure

The below is based on the user I identified, right from the stat I felt this had to be a very gallery/video oriented layout in order to really sell to potential/returning customers.

**Homepage** - This had to be eye catching whilst setting the tone for the whole project- To do this you are met with a scrolling video carousel that has links to more videos to really draw the user in.

**About** - This helps tell the user who Bora Bora VIP are and what they have to offer- This is meant to give the user confidence that this company will take care of you and its money well spent. It has weather???? and a gallery again to showcase the beauty & luxury of the destination.

**Experiences & Activities** - This page goes into detail about what you can do and has a wide ranging selection to cater to all the users mentioned.

\*_Contact_ - After the user has experienced the website if they still have any questions this page is here to encourage contact and help develop a relationship with potential customers.

### Skeleton

I have included the wireframes for my site in the Documentation folder in this repository.

[**Mobile Wireframes**](?)

[**Tablet Wireframes**]?)

[**Laptop/Desktop**](?)

### Surface

The palette used was very light and bright I feel this helps the content (gallery/videos stand out to the user, I wanted to avoid strong bold colours.
